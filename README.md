# Do you really need Redux?

## What's this?

This repository contains an app created for MeetJS Białystok, Feb 2020 talk by Wojciech Tałałaj.

## Why?

Redux, although being very popular across the web devs' world, has its flaws. I'd like you to get to know them. Please, bear in mind though that I don't tell anybody to stop using Redux. It's rather that some fields exist where it can be a performance bottleneck or power consumer in the long run.

### And only that?

Absolutely nope. It's also about learning something about other ways to organize your data flow.

## Installing & running

This is an app created with CRA. Treat it like so. `npm i`, `npm start` and you're good to go.

## I've got something to say about XYZ

Cool, let's talk. My point of view is not the only valid source of truth.
